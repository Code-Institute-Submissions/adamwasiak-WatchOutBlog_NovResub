-The focus of functional testing was to ensure that the logic required was observed during the game and that the user experience remained in line with expectations. 
During testing the following aspects were reviewed:

1. upon selection of either paper, rock or scissors that the correct image was appearing in the player selection area
2. that the logic of declaring winning party at the comparison stage was correct 
3. that points were being added correctly upon user or computer being declared as winner of individual round
4. pop up messages (below Player and Computer selection areas) were also corresponding correctly to the outcome of the round
5. that after number of rounds, correct party with 5 point was being declared as winner
